	description "Once they left human space, it became apparent to the Remnant that they would need to build their own shipyards in order to defend themselves if they were discovered by the Alphas or any other unfriendly faction. Using new composite materials that they discovered, they built ships very different from anything seen in human space."
	description "	Spurred on by their exposure to alien ruins, the Remnant have ensured that every ship has detailed scanners built into their hull. While they continue to hope to find wrecks to accompany the ruins, these scanners have proven invaluable in their pursuit of livelier ships."

	description "The Argosy from Southbound Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Syndicate Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat even against a small pirate fleet."

	description "The Lionheart Bactrian is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance."
	description "	Naturally, this versatility also makes it extremely expensive, and the Bactrian is normally only for sale to citizens who have been vetted by the local government of the Deep."

	description `Though the Syndicate doesn't build fighter carriers, it is testing the waters with the Barb, a cheap and flexible carrier-launched craft featuring newly-developed miniaturized ion engines. The design philosophy of the Barb seems to have been "uglier than the Protector," and as you look at the cockpit nestled between the massive gun port and turret mount, you wonder where the power systems are supposed to go. Though an awkward-looking ship, it seems flexible enough to become a dangerous addition to any fleet with carriers.`

	description "While the Starling was the first successful ship to use technology derived from alien ruins, the Gull is the most recent. The current increase in Korath activities has caused foraging for resources to become a risky endeavor, forcing the Remnant to develop a specialized freighter for hauling cargo from remote sites without revealing their presence to hostile aliens."
	description "	The Gull has quickly proven its worth, allowing the Starling fleets to return to riskier activities while the Gull takes over the hazardous convoy routes. It is now the primary element of the Remnant's extra-territorial resource operations."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Gull's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

Armed with a variety of weapons, and with relatively good maneuverability for a ship its size, the Frigate is equally capable at fending off small fighters or bombarding larger ships."

While they are not technically alive, their internal mechanisms and method of construction bear such a close resemblance to living organisms that they are often considered as such. These ships serve as the backbone of Remnant salvage efforts, as well as their resource distribution network."

	description "Classified as an interceptor rather than a fighter because it has its own hyperdrive instead of needing to be carried inside a larger ship, the Tarazed Sparrow is the smallest and cheapest combat ship available. Because of its limited cargo and passenger space, the primary way for a Sparrow pilot to pay the bills is by hunting pirates... or by becoming one. In either case, it is a perilous way to earn a living."
	description "	Insurance reports indicate that as many as two out of every three first-time ship buyers who choose to pilot a Sparrow lose their ship (and often, their life as well) within the first month of owning it. Pilots who have survived longer than that tend to swear by replacing the stock weapons with missile launchers."

	description "The design of the Water Bug is almost as old as the Aphid, but until recently it never saw much use. A spike in aggression from the Unfettered Hai has lead the tougher and more well-defended Water Bug to see an increase in popularity over its little brother, the Aphid. The Water Bug is now the most widely used Hai freighter, comprising the bulk of all Hai merchant fleets."
